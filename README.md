# Conjunctive Inverted Index

This repository contains two minimal, well-tested implementations for multi-term search over documents:

- `src/inverted_index.py`: a classic inverted index with set intersections for AND queries.
- `src/conjunctive_index_binary.py`: a binary-encoded variant that treats each documentâ€™s term set as a bitmask and answers conjunctive (AND) queries via bitwise checks.

The goal is to show simple, clear baselines for conjunctive (multi-term) search and highlight trade-offs between straightforward posting-list intersections and compact bitmask-based filtering.

For background and motivation, see the article:
